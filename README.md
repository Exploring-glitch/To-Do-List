<h1>To-Do List</h1>

<p># What is this?</p>
<p>This is a simple lightweight and user-friendly To-Do application where users can add tasks and delete tasks once completed. To make this project, I used simple HTML, TAILWIND CSS and JAVASCRIPT.</p>

<p># Features:</p>
<p>1.   Add Task</p>
<p>2.   View the tasks in a clear interface</p>
<p>3.   Delete Tasks when completed</p>
