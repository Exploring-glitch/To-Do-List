A To-Do List

What is this?
This is a simple lightweight and user-friendly To-Do application where users can add tasks and delete tasks once completed. To make this project, I used simple HTML, TAILWIND CSS and JAVASCRIPT.

Features:
1.   Add Task
2.   View the tasks in a clear interface
3.   Delete Tasks when completed
